        The main idea is to treat your skills like animals and send them to the
        right forest to hunt. On LinkedIn, this means connecting only with
        people and groups where your skills can add some value.
      </p>

          Step 1: Understand Connection Levels
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4">LinkedIn has three levels of connections:</p>

        <ul class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">1st-degree connections:</span> People
            you are already connected with. You can message them directly.
            <br /><span class="text-gray-500"
              >Example: Your batchmates, colleagues, or people you’ve already
              connected with.</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">2nd-degree connections:</span> People
            connected to your 1st-degree connections but not to you but you can
            send them a connection request. <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">3rd-degree connections:</span> People
            connected to your 2nd-degree connections they are more far away from
            you. Their profile visibility can be limited to you depending on
            their privacy settings. <br />
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="italic text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
          Why this matters: Start building your forest gradually, start sending
          connection requests 2nd and 3rd-degree connections it will expand you
          connection.
        </p>
      </div>

          Step 2: Sending Connection Requests
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          LinkedIn limits the number of connection requests you can send per
          week to prevent spam. You can send around 100 requests per week, which
          means 400 requests per month. Honestly speaking, this is more than
          enough. Let me give you a small example:

          <br />
          <br />

          If you target 4 companies each month, 400 connections per month ÷ 4 =
          100 requests for each company. Even though 30% of people may not
          accept your request, you will still have 60–70 connections in each
          company/community. In <span class="font-semibold">Secret-2</span> you
          can use these connections strategically.
        </p>

          <span class="font-semibold">Tips:</span> Always add a
          <span class="font-semibold">personalized-note</span>. Don’t just click
          “Connect”.
        </p>

        Maximize your chances of getting replies or referrals by messaging a

          Find a job that interests you anywhere. Example:
          <span class="font-semibold">Content Creator role at Microsoft</span>.
          Apply first on LinkedIn or the company website.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 italic text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
          Concept: A single application rarely gets attention; messaging
          multiple people in your network improves your probability of a

            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
              Focus on people 2–3 years ahead of you. They are approachable,

              effectively.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-1">
              Example: If you’re a junior content creator, connect with someone
